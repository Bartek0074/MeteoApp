# MeteoApp

This is a nice React Weather App, where you can find the current weather and weather forecast of your/others city. I was building this app using React.js and the help of [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Demo

Get a free api key from OpenWeather. Get it [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Create a .env file in the root of your project folder and add the following.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_OPEN_WEATHER]
```

Install dependencies. Make sure you already have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your system.
